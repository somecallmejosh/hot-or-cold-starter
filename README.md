Hot Or Cold Game
=================

In this game, the computer will randomly select a number between 1 and 100. The player then tries to guess the number. The player gets feedback for each guess â€” **hot** if their guess was close, and **cold** if their guess was far off. Once the correct number is guessed, the player will be notified and given the option to start a new game.
